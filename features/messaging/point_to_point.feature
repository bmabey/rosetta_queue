Story: Point-to-Point Producing and Consuming

  As a RosettaQueue user
  I want to publish and consume point-to-point using various messaging protocols
  So that I can reliably integrate my systems with a message broker

	Scenario Outline: Point-to-Point
	Given RosettaQueue is configured for <Adapter>
	And a point-to-point destination is set
	When a message is published to queue 'foo'
	    Then the message should be consumed
	
	Examples:
	| Adapter 	|
	| amqp		|
	| stomp		| 
	

	# Scenario Outline: Publish-Subscribe
	# Given RosettaQueue is configured for <Adapter>
	# And a publish-subscribe destination is set
	# When a message is published to topic foobar
	# Then multiple messages should be consumed from the topic
	# 
	# Examples:
	# | Adapter 	|
	# | amqp		|
	# # | stomp		| 
	# #
