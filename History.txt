== 0.5.0 (proposed - the "Resource Cleanup" release)
 === New Features (Relevance Inc.)
 * Fixed a socket leak in Producer#publish by using open on the Adapter (at least for Stomp, but probably others too).
 * Add Adapter#open, which has semantics like File#open (ie auto-disconnecting the socket after the block)
 * Allow specifying a key when adding handlers to a consumer, to allow multiple instances of same consumer
 * Add big warnings around Adapter#instance -- its _not_ a singleton, even though its named like one

== 0.4.0
 === New features
 * Allows for custom exception handling logic to be registered for publishing and consuming actions. See ExceptionHandler for more info. (Ben Mabey)
  * RQ was doing a blanket rescue for publishing and consuming and then logging the errors.  If you still want this behaviour you will need to register a block/class to do that. Again, see ExceptionHandler for more details.
 * Added core time extension when ActiveSupport not present. (Chris Wyckoff)
 === Bugfixes
 * Closing the connection after publishing message now instead of unsubscribing. (Chris Wyckoff)


== 0.2.0
 === New features
  * Synchronous AMQP adapter (Chris Wyckoff - Lead Media Partners)
    * Uses celldee's synchronous AMQP client, 'Bunny'.
  * Added .delete method to Consumer class (Chris Wyckoff - Lead Media Partners)
    * Allows user to purge a queue.
    * Works for AMQP adapters only.
 === Bugfixes
  * client :ack now working. (Chris Wyckoff - Lead Media Partners)

== 0.1.4

 === New features
  * Removed dependency on ActiveSupport and brought over needed String methods. (Derek and Matt - Greenview Data, Inc.)
  * Safer shutdown in ThreadedManager (Rob Sanheim - Relevance)
  * Beanstalk Adaper (David Brady - Lead Media Partners)
    * Still needs some work to have it take advantage of beanstalk's subscribe functionality.

== 0.1.0 / 2008-01-28 - Initial Release
RosettaQueue was realased in the wild! RQ's initial development was primarily sponsored by Alliance Health Networks (thanks!!).  The original authors were Chris Wyckoff and Ben Mabey. The initial release included adapters for stomp and amqp, in addition to a null and fake adapters for testing.
